# Here, we list the Playlist classes that are inside the experiments.py module
# that are to be imported into the wilhelm server database.  The name field is
# how the experiment will be named in the database.  The include field lists
# out the experiment's dependencies. These files and the source code of the
# Playlist class itself will be checksummed in order to monitor when the source
# code of the experiment was last modified.  The blurb will be for the listing
# of the experiment on the experiment web site. The note is a note for the
# experimenters only.
