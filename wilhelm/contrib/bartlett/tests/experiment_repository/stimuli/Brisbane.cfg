    page1 = '''
In this experiment, your memory for lists of words or short texts will be
tested. In each part of the experiment, you will be shown either a list of
words or else you will read a short text. 

In each word list, there will be around 20 words. These will be presented to
you one word at a time, each for duration of approximately 1 second. 

The texts you will read will be approximately 200 words long and you will have
up to 2 minutes to read it.
'''

    page2 = ''' 
Your memory for the word lists or the texts will be tested either by a
*recognition memory* test or by a *recall* test.

In a recognition memory test, you will be presented with words, shown one at a
time, and you will indicate whether each word was in the word list or text that
you saw. For each word, you will have a few seconds to decide. 

In the recall memory test, you will be given a set of text boxes where you will
type in all the words that you can remember seeing in the word list or text.
'''

    page3 = '''
There are 6 parts in total in this experiment. Each part presents either a word
list or else a text, which is then followed by either a recognition memory test
or a recall test.

Each part lasts between 3 and 4 minutes.

After each part of the experiment, you will have the choice of either
continuing immediately onto the next part of else pausing the experiment. If
you pause, you will be able to continue the experiment whenever you like and
from any other computer.

        text = '''Flu is a viral infection which can make even the
        fittest person feel quite ill. The symptoms of flu may last
        several days, usually starting with a high temperature often
        with a headache. Your limbs can ache and your muscles can feel
        weak. You may also have a dry irritating cough, a sore throat
        and a runny, itchy nose. Flu can spread very rapidly, so it is
        easy to catch and to pass on to others. Flu is most likely to
        affect you in the autumn and winter, e.g. from October to
        March. However some people are more at risk than others.  If
        you are elderly, have a heart, lung or kidney disorder or have
        diabetes, you should take particular care not to catch flu. If
        you are one of those patients who are at greater risk from
        flu, you should try to avoid catching it. A flu vaccination
        can help to protect you from flu. One simple injection,
        normally given in the autumn, can help to protect you right
        through the cold months when flu is most prevalent.  Your
        doctor will normally be able to vaccinate you with a flu
        vaccine. Only one quick injection is necessary to help give
        you the protection you may need from flu. '''

    [['pulse']]

        text =  ''' This routine is designed to increase a person's
        pulse rate, and then to monitor its decrease over a set period
        of time. The rate of decrease of the pulse after vigorous
        exercise is a good indication of the overall fitness of an
        individual.  The routine should not be attempted by anyone
        with a heart condition or high blood pressure. If you have any
        doubts about your present health, you must consult your doctor
        beforehand. The only equipment you need is a watch or a clock
        with a second hand or second display.  The 3 easiest places to
        take your pulse are the wrist, the side of the neck and the
        temples. To take your pulse all you need to do is to count it
        for 10 seconds and then multiply by 6. This will give your
        pulse rate per minute. At the start of the routine, when you
        are in a relaxed state, you take your pulse and note the
        reading. At the end of the very last exercise you immediately
        take your pulse again and note the reading.  You then wait,
        standing still for 1 minute, and take a final pulse reading.
        Subtract the third reading from the second, which will
        generally give you a value between 0 and 50, This is the value
        which indicates your fitness: 0-10 is poor, 10-20 is fair,
        20-30 is average, 30-40 is good, 40-50 is very good, and 50+
        is excellent. Your pulse rate will continue to decrease until
        it reverts to the first reading. The time taken to revert to
        the relaxed state is directly related to the fitness of the
        body.'''
