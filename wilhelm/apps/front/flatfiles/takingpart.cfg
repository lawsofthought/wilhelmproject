title = 'How to take part'

text = '''Anyone over 18 is welcome to take part in the experiments on this
site. 

Each experiment usually has a few parts, with each part taking between 3 and 5
minutes. You are to pause the experiment after each part and the return to it
whenever you like.

After each experiment, you will be shown how you performed and what
these results might mean.

Participating in these experiments is purely voluntary. Sometimes people
volunteer just out of curiosity and sometimes out of an interest in cognitive
science and to learn more about how the mind works. 

To take part, we will need you to login using an email address and password of
your choice, or else via your account with social media networks like Facebook,
Twitter, Google, etc. 

We need each participant to login in this way so that we can keep track of
whether they have done the experiment already. However, we never use any
personal identifying information with the data that we collect, nor do we ever
share this information in any way. See `Privacy & Confidentiality </privacy>`_
for more information.  '''
