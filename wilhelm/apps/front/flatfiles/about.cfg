title = 'About Cognition Experiments'

text = '''The experiments on this website are used by researchers in cognitive
science and related fields to collect data as part of their ongoing research.

`Cognitive science <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science>`_ is the
study of how the mind works and so the experiments here are used to study
phenomena like how our memory works, how we reason and make decisions, how we
process the spoken and written language that we hear or read everyday, and so
on.

Experiments that study these basic processes of the mind have been carried out
inside labs in Psychology departments in universities for over a hundred years.
In recent years, we have started to carry out some of them online using
websites like this one. 

Online behavioural experiments have the obvious advantage that they can be done
quickly and efficiently and reach a wider potential group of people.
