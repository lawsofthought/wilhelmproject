and confidentially.

Although participants in the experiments must login using their email address

information are stored with the recorded data from the experiments. 

All participants are assigned a unique random number as an identifier, and
their data is stored under this identifier only. 

Personal identifying information, like email addresses or social media
usernames, are never made public nor shared with others under any
circumstances. These are only used to allow you to access this website, and
these will be deleted when the experiments here are completed.
